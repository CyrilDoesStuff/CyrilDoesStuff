### Hello everyone!
I'm a college student who's planning to write code in Python. Maybe even make games. I'm also a digital artist. My pronouns are he/him, by the way.
### Current plans
None.
### Contact me
One way of getting in touch with me is through Discord (cyrildraws). That is if you'll have anything to say about the projects I'll release in the future. For now, I'd rather keep it friends only.
