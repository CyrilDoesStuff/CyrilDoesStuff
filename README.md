### Hello everyone!
I'm just a college student who's planning to write code in C++ and Python. Maybe even make games. I'm also a digital artist. My pronouns are he/him, by the way.
### Current plans
Currently, I'm learning Python.
### Contact me
One way of getting in touch with me is through Discord (CyrilDraws#3009). That is if you'll have anything to say about the projects I'll release in the future. For now, I'd rather keep it friends only.
